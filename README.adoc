== CS 125 IntelliJ Plugin

This plugin is intended to simplify development for CS 125 students and help us
track their activity and progress.

The plugin was created using the
//
https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/tutorials/build_system.html[IntelliJ
Gradle plugin]
//
and is implemented in
//
https://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin].

=== Usage

Depends on the existence of the hidden file `.cs125`. File name will be customizable once configuration is sorted out.

=== IntelliJ Plugin Documentation

Please review the
//
https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/welcome.html[IntelliJ plugin
development documentation carefully].
//
It is quite comprehensive.

=== Development Environment Setup

The IntelliJ Gradle plugin does an excellent job of setting up your development
environment properly.
//
The "Plugin" run configuration will launch a second copy of IntelliJ IDEA with
the plugin enabled.

It is helpful to be able to view the logs in the original development instance
of IntelliJ.
//
To do this, modify the logs section of the run configuration as follows:

image::docs/log_configuration.png[]

You will need to change the path to the log file created by the testing instance
of IntelliJ.
//
When it is launched, it creates a subdirectory of the build directory to store
its build files separately from the main development copy.
//
That is where you'll find the log file.

=== Useful Examples

Here are a few useful plugins to reference:

. https://github.com/dkandalov/pomodoro-tm[Pomodoro]: good example of a recent
plugin developed in Kotlin.
//
Runs a timer to encourage programmers to take breaks periodically.
//
. https://github.com/wakatime/jetbrains-wakatime[Wakatime]: best example of a
plugin that does almost exactly what we are trying to do.
//
The actions that we instrument are currently borrowed from this plugin.
//
However, it seems to require Python for some reason even on the client, and so
serves only as an example and not as a starting point.

=== Current Status

==== `CS125GradeAction.kt`

This file defines an action that we will eventually use to launch local
autograding when the student clicks on our button.

At this point that linkage is done in `plugin.xml`, but all the action does is
log a message.
//
We need to figure out how to launch a Gradle task at this point.

Note that we should also figure out a way to hide our menu and icons when a
student is working on a non-CS 125 project.
//
That will probably also happen here, but also requires a way to identify CS 125
repositories.

==== `CS125Component.kt`

This file defines what happens on plugin startup.
//
It should register any listeners that we need as well as respond to events, log
data locally, and upload information to the server.

At this point a preliminary set of listeners are set up borrowed from the
Wakatime plugin.
//
The following actions trigger logging messages:

* *document save*: note that this happens asynchronously
//
* *document modifications*
//
* *mouse press*
//
* *visible contents changed*: this is triggered by scrolling and (it seems) by
switching between multiple editor windows

All of these trigger logging the file that was used along with the project.

==== Action counting

Each of the documentation modifications should update one of a set of counters,
which are then saved and cleared regularly by a task triggered by a periodic
timer.

==== Data Storage and Transfer

Periodically we post all saved activity logs to a web endpoint.
//
If the web server is not available, the logs are stored and the transmission will be retried later.
//

This will need a configuration file, and I wonder if the
 configuration should live in the project somewhere, so that when
we load a project we search for a configuration, use it if we find it, and
disable the plugin if we don't.
//
This would also make it easier to support multiple courses that might have
different ways of identifying students, want to use different endpoints, and
want to use different icons.

==== Persistent state across IDE restarts

IntelliJ provides a way for plugins to persist state across IDE restarts.
//
We should use this to make sure that we don't lose any data if students work
without a network connection, or if the IDE is closed while there are still some
events that haven't been uploaded yet.

==== Other information to record

We should continue to add events to the things that we record.
//
Extra information could include:

* Use of testing suites
//
* Editor line counts to track development progress
//
* Cut and paste, particularly paste from an external source
//
* Estimates of typing speed


==== Data Output Format

```json
{
    "emails": ["aaronjl2@illinois.edu"],
    "activity_session_logs": [
      {
        "START_TIMESTAMP": 1230435234,
        "END_TIMESTAMP": 12404312233,
        "ACTION_LOGS": {
          "ACTIVE": 70,
          "PROJ_OPEN": 14,
          "PROJ_CLOSE": 82,
          "DOC_SAVE": 94,
          "DOC_MOD": 11,
          "TEST_RUN": 2
        }
      }
    ]
}
```

*Action Types*

1. `ACTIVE`: Click/Press Mouse/Scroll
1. `PROJ_OPEN`: Project Open
1. `PROJ_CLOSE`: Project Close
1. `DOC_SAVE`: Document Save
1. `DOC_MOD`: Document Modification
1. `TEST_RUN`: Test Suite Run

*Emails*

A set of all emails pulled from the `email.txt` file in the root folder of the "in focus" project directory. From this, we will be able to check if any students have an MP open on their computer that isn't theirs.

*Start/End Timestamp*

The beginning and ending timestamp for the data block.
